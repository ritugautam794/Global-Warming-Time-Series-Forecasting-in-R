# Time series Forecasting

## Summary 
Global warming, a phenomenon marked by an overall increase in Earth's average surface temperature, has sparked extensive debates with varying perspectives on its seriousness and causes. To provide a comprehensive, fact-based understanding of the situation, this report presents a statistical analysis of global temperature data from two prominent sources, NASA, and the UK MET Office. Through rigorous analyses, the report addresses key concerns related to global warming, forecasts future temperature trends, assesses the accuracy of claims, and examines the "Climate Bet" debate. 

This report employs statistical analyses of global temperature data to provide evidence-based insights into global warming. The findings support concerns about temperature rise, discredit claims of halted warming, and validate assertions of increased temperature fluctuations. The "Climate Bet" analysis underscores the necessity of robust models, while long-term analyses emphasize the dynamic nature of climate patterns. These findings contri
